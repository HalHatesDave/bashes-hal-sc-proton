A super simple set of scripts I created to help install and run Star Citizen with UMU-Launcher and GE-Proton.

SC-Install will download and install RSI Launcher to /Games/star-citizen. After which you can run SC-Proton.

SC-Proton sets up some env that work well for me, then launches Star Citizen using UMU with a -10 niceness and a MangoHUD on the middle-left

This is my first script that I actually use, so yay! :sunglas:
